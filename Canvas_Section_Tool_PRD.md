## 1. **Overview**

The Section Management Tool is a lightweight, educator-friendly interface built directly within Canvas LMS to streamline the creation, allocation, and management of student sections. This tool is designed to augment or replace the limitations of existing systems such as Canvas Groups and AllocatePlus, while ensuring fairness, compliance, and improved user experience for educators.

---

## 2. **Goals & Objectives**

* Enable educators to create and manage sections within Canvas intuitively.
* Automatically balance student-to-educator ratios (target: 1:25).
* Support manual and automated student allocation workflows.
* Integrate census date workflows (pre-finalization and locking).
* Ensure privacy-safe section naming and student visibility handling.
* Provide a future-ready tool that can be scaled or commercialized.

**Success Metrics:**
* 90% reduction in time spent on section management
* 100% compliance with student privacy requirements
* 95% accuracy in automated student allocation
* < 1% error rate in section assignments
* 100% uptime during critical census periods

## 5. **User Stories**

### Educator

* As an educator, I want to auto-allocate students into balanced sections so that I don't have to do it manually.
* As an educator, I want to manually assign students to sections via a simple UI so that I can maintain control.
* As an educator, I want to preview and approve auto-assignments before saving them.
* As an educator, I want to hide section names from students or rename them appropriately to avoid student distress.
* As an educator, I want to receive a warning when using potentially problematic section names so I can correct them.
* As an educator, I want to override automated logic to move specific students where needed.

### Unit Coordinator

* As a lead educator, I want to define the census date so that section locking aligns with university policy.
* As a lead educator, I want to lock section allocations post-census to prevent further changes.
* As a lead educator, I want to review an audit trail of section changes.

### Canvas Admin
